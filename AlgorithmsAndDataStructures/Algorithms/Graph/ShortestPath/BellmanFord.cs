Negative weighted edges allowed: YES
Complexity: worst(V*E)(which can lead to quadratic complexity for dense graphs), best - (E) (An example of a graph that would only need one round of relaxation is a graph where each vertex only connects to the next one in a linear fashion)
Application: Most famous - distance-vector routing protocol. This protocol decides how to route packets of data on a network.
The distance equation (to decide weights in the network) is the number of routers a certain path must go through to reach its destination.
